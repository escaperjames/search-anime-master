# Anime Search
**Anime Search** is a Flask web scraping application allowing you to find out on which legal streaming platform you can watch the animation series you are looking for.

The data is retrieved from the [Nautiljon] website (https://www.nautiljon.com/).

The link to the site [Anime Search](https://emmanuel-cse17019.herokuapp.com/).


## The application has 3 pages:
- The *home* page for searching for a series.
- The *results display* page which shows the results corresponding to our search.
- The page of *details* of a series, where you can see information about the series.

The application also allows you to view the details of a series more quickly at the expense of image quality by activating the * "Speed Mode" * button on the search page.
